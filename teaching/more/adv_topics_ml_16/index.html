</h2>
<p>In this seminar, we will cover how to make good decisions using machine learning. <em>Reinforcement learning</em> and <em>multi-armed bandits</em> are just some of the methods that combine decision making with machine learning. These methods play a crucial role in countless real problems such as when personalizing websites, navigating robots, managing supply chains and revenue, and even when playing Go!</p>
<p>We will cover how to trade off <em>exploitation</em> and <em>exploration</em>; that is when to act with the current data versus acquiring additional data to make a better decision later. The exploration/exploitation tradeoff is a key challenge in reinforcement learning. We will also cover the related issues of <em>reliability</em> and <em>robustness</em> in machine learning.</p>
<p>Some of the specific topics we will cover are:</p>
<ul>
<li>A/B testing and randomized experiments</li>
<li>Optimizer&rsquo;s curse</li>
<li>Thompson sampling, UCB, EXP3</li>
<li>(Robust) Markov decision processes</li>
<li>Gittins and Whittle indices</li>
<li>Tree and policy search</li>
<li>Covariate shift</li>
</ul>
<p>The class will start with an overview of fundamental problems, methods, and techniques and will continue with student presentations and a research project.</p>



<h3 id="pre-requisites">
  <a class="Heading-link u-clickable" href="../../../teaching/more/adv_topics_ml_16/#pre-requisites">Pre-requisites</a>
</h3>
<p>Statistics and some linear algebra. Machine learning is not a pre-requisite. We will cover topics that are closely related to ML but do not depend on it.</p>
