These methods play a crucial role in countless real problems such as when personalizing websites, navigating robots, managing supply chains and revenue, and even when playing Go! \n\n\nWe will cover how to trade off \nexploitation\n and \nexploration\n; that is when to act with the current data versus acquiring additional data to make a better decision later. The exploration/exploitation tradeoff is a key challenge in reinforcement learning. We will also cover the related issues of \nreliability\n and \nrobustness\n in machine learning.\n\n\nSome of the specific topics we will cover are:\n\n\n\n\nA/B testing and randomized experiments\n\n\nOptimizer's curse\n\n\nThompson sampling, UCB, EXP3\n\n\n(Robust) Markov decision processes\n\n\nGittins and Whittle indices\n\n\nTree and policy search\n\n\nCovariate shift\n\n\n\n\nThe class will start with an overview of fundamental problems, methods, and techniques and will continue with student presentations and a research project.\n\n\nPre-requisites\n\n\nStatistics and some linear algebra. Machine learning is not a pre-requisite. We will cover topics that are closely related to ML but do not depend on it.\n\n\nMore details\n\n\nPlease see the class website: \nhttps://bitbucket.org/2016advml/class/wiki",

            "text": "In this seminar, we will cover how to make good decisions using machine learning.  Reinforcement learning  and  multi-armed bandits  are just some of the methods that combine decision making with machine learning. These methods play a crucial role in countless real problems such as when personalizing websites, navigating robots, managing supply chains and revenue, and even when playing Go!   We will cover how to trade off  exploitation  and  exploration ; that is when to act with the current data versus acquiring additional data to make a better decision later. The exploration/exploitation tradeoff is a key challenge in reinforcement learning. We will also cover the related issues of  reliability  and  robustness  in machine learning.  Some of the specific topics we will cover are:   A/B testing and randomized experiments  Optimizer's curse  Thompson sampling, UCB, EXP3  (Robust) Markov decision processes  Gittins and Whittle indices  Tree and policy search  Covariate shift   The class will start with an overview of fundamental problems, methods, and techniques and will continue with student presentations and a research project.",
